# FCC-Project-Weather
Intermediate level frontend project as part of [FreeCodeCamp][fcc] using [Wikipedia API][wikiAPI].


**Hosted on Github Pages**  
This app can be accessed through [https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-wikipedia-viewer/public]("https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-wikipedia-viewer/public" "Weather project on github pages").  

**Mixed content warning**  
Github pages is a secure site (https). Since the app uses weather icon from open weather API, which is http, some browsers raise a warning on this saying you are trying to load 'unsecure content'/'mixed content'. This means, the page contains both secured and non-secured content. The unsafe content part of the site is vulnerable for tampering requests and responses.
